## Repositories

### APS (Algoritmi e Protocolli per la Sicurezza)
The APS repository contains the project developed for the Algoritmi e Protocolli per la Sicurezza (Algorithms and Protocols for Security) course. It consists of Python code focusing on various security algorithms and protocols. The project explores encryption, decryption, authentication, and other security-related concepts.

### EmbeddedSystems
The EmbeddedSystems repository hosts the firmware developed for a project in the Embedded Systems course. It includes models, simulations, and code written in MATLAB/Simulink for controlling an induction cooker. The repository also contains documentation, test cases, and deployment files.

### MachineLearning
The MachineLearning repository is dedicated to the project developed for the Machine Learning course. It contains machine learning models, algorithms, and experiments implemented using PyTorch, a deep learning framework. The project explores various machine learning techniques and applications in computer engineering.
